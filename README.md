# BitcoinTicker


In this project, you see the list of coins after registering and logging in. You can search for the coin you want, enter the detail page and see the comparison with other currencies. On the detail page, you can select a currency you want and see the period and historical changes in its history as a list and chart.
You can add it to your favorite list with the star on the top right of the detail page, and you can enter the same flow in the favorite section at the bottom of the page. If you have more than one favourite, you can search.
